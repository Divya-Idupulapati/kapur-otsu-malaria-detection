## 📌 Project Overview

Accurate and timely diagnosis of malaria is critical for treatment and control. This project focuses on using image segmentation and machine learning to classify different *Plasmodium* species (P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. vivax) from blood smear images. We use advanced multilevel thresholding techniques — **Kapur’s entropy-based** and **Otsu’s method** — followed by classification using the **Random Forest** algorithm.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Manual diagnosis of malaria from blood smear images is time-consuming and prone to error. Automating the segmentation and classification of *Plasmodium* species can speed up diagnosis, reduce error, and make expert-level diagnostics accessible in low-resource settings.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

* Apply Kapur and Otsu thresholding to segment RGB blood smear images.
* Extract Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features from segmented images.
* Classify segmented images into three *Plasmodium* species using Random Forest.
* Evaluate the entropy and segmentation quality of each method.
